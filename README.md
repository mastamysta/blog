<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The aim of this project is to produce a small personal log website to be hosted on my personal domain: https://www.benread.dev
  I will create a blog site which allows me to sign in (as the sole user) and quickly post small chunks of prose (an hopefully images). Possible extensions might included a small mobile app that allows me to post while on the go.
